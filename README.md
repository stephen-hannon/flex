# Online Flex Point Analyzer

## Development

First, make sure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node & NPM](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Clone the repository and install the modules from the `flexible` directory:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/stephen-hannon/flexible.git && cd flexible
$ npm install
```

Flexible uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle its assets, so start a development server to avoid manually re-compiling after each save:

```bash
$ npm run start
```

To build for production, run:

```bash
$ npm run build
```
